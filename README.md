# embassyautomator
Automator for CRBA or Passports


Hit F12 or Inspect

Click Console 

Then copy and paste either the Passport Code or CRBA depending on what you need


Then go to the embassy site (TLV/JLM) or whatever country you are in

https://evisaforms.state.gov/acs/default.asp?postcode=JRS&appcode=1 for example

Then paste the code in the console, click enter... then wait a few seconds... you'll need to do this for make appt as well as the next screen

After, you will proceed as normal and change months or years... and if there is an opening... fill out as usual 


TLDR it just automates the first two steps (by using JS to click on elements) of the process for now... I am really busy so please don't PM me... just open an issue on this repo with questions... this works in Chrome and Edge for Desktop only (Firefox requires an extra step or two)...

No scraping or anythign illegal is happening... just clicks on some elements for you to save time. 

and feel free to contribute code!
